/** Async IO module for Data storage abstraction layer.
 * The module API allows users to submit a single IO operation into the
 * underlying data storage and get a notification (success/failure) in
 * a user-defined callback/callbacks.
 *
 * Threading
 * ---------
 * User-defined callbacks are called from DSAL-backend-owned threads.
 * It means it is up to the user to pass this information to the right
 * consumer.
 *
 * Memory
 * ------
 * The module provides types for IO operations to ensure that the caller
 * does not need to use heap allocations for each IO operation.
 * However, it introduces another problem - an ABI between the modules.
 * In order to make sure that, this won't cause undefined behavior on the
 * DSAL side, the init function checks the size.
 *
 * Usage
 * -------------
 *
 * @{code}
 * // A structure on the caller side to be used
 * // as a user-defined context for AIO operations.
 * // In this example we simply use it to count
 * // the amount of ongoing IO operations.
 * struct fd_state {
 *	struct dsal_obj *obj;
 *	// Number of active IO operations.
 *	atomic_int_t n_inflight
 * };
 *
 * void dsal_write_cb(void *ctx, struct dsal_op *op, int rc)
 * {
 *   struct fd_state *state = ctx;
 *   state->n_inflight--;
 *   // dsal_op is destroyed by dsal aio module.
 * }
 *
 * int dsal_write(struct fd_state *state, void *data, off_t offset, size_t count)
 * {
 *   struct dsal_aio_op op;
 *   int rc;
 *   rc = dsal_obj_create_aio_op(state->obj, &op, dsal_write_cb, state);
 *   if (rc != 0) {
 *     return rc;
 *   }
 *   rc = dsal_aio_op_write(&op, data, offset, count);
 *   if (rc != 0) {
 *      dsal_aio_op_fini(&op);
 *      return rc;
 *   }
 *   rc = dsal_aio_op_submit(&op);
 *   if (rc != 0) {
 *      dsal_aio_op_fini(&op);
 *      return rc;
 *   }
 *   state->n_inflight++;
 *   return rc;
 * }
 * @{endcode}
