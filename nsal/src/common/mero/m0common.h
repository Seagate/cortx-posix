/* Key Iterator */

/* TODO:PERF:
 *	Performance of key iterators can be improved by:
 *	1. Usage of prefetch.
 *	2. Async Clovis calls.
 *	3. Piggyback data for records.
 *	The features can be implemented without significant changes in
 *	the caller code and mostly isolated in the m0common module.
 *
 *	1. The key prefetch feature requires an additional argument to specify
 *	the amount of records to retrieve in a NEXT clovis call.
 *	Then, key_iter_next walks over the prefetched records and issues
 *	a NEXT call after the last portion of records was processed by the user.
 *
 *	2. The async clovis calls feature can be used to speed up the case
 *	where the time of records processing by the caller is comparable with
 *	the time needed to receive next bunch of records from Clovis.
 *	In this case a initial next call synchronously gets a bunch of records,
 *	and then immediately issues an asynchronous NEXT call.
 *	The consequent next call waits for the issued records,
 *	and again issues a NEXT call to clovis. In conjunction with the prefetch
 *	feature, it can help to speed up readdir() by issuing NEXT (dentry)
 *	and GET (inode attrs) concurrently.
 *
 *	3. Since readdir requires a combination of NEXT + GET calls,
 *	the iterator can issue a GET call to get the inode attirbutes of
 *	prefetched dentries along with the next portion of NEXT dentries.
 *	So that, we can get a chunk of dentries and the attributes of the
 *	previous chunck witin a single clovis call.
 *	However, this feature make sense only for the recent version of
 *	nfs-ganesha where a FSAL is resposible for filling in attrlist
 *	(the current version calls fsal_getattr() instead of it).
