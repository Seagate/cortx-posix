/* Low-level Design
 *
 * EFS File Handle Overview.
 * -----------------------------------
 *
 * EFS File Handle (efs)fh) is an in-memory object that represents
 * a file object such as a regular file, a directory, a symlink etc.
 *
 * File Handles are obtained from the CORTXFS API using LOOKUP, READDIR or
 * deserialize calls.
 * These calls construct a new file handle per found object. READDIR produces
 * a file handle per each iteration over a directory.
 * File Handles cannot be constructed without making calls to the underlying
 * storage (to fetch stat).
 *
 * Root File Handle is a special file handle that can be constructed by
 * GETROOT call without specifying (parent_inode, dentry_name) pair.
 * However, it is still a subject to access checks.
 *
 *
 * FH Properties.
 * --------------
 * A File Handle object has the following properties:
 *	- Storage-level unique key (ObjectFID, IndexFID).
 *	- FS-level unique inode number (uint64_t).
 *	- per-object read-only attributes (type).
 *	- per-object mutable attributes (mode_t, uid:gid, {a,c,m}time).
 *	- Runtime locks.
 *
 *
 * FH Serialization.
 * --------------
 *
 * CORTXFS Users can serialize a FH into a buffer of a pre-defined size, store
 * it somewhere, and deseiralize later. Also, FH supports obtaining of a unique
 * in-memory key to be used in containers (maps, sets).
 * Methods:
 *	- FH.serialize(buffer) - Writes on-wire representation into buffer.
 *	- FH.key(buffer) - Writes unique in-memory key of the FH.
 *	- deserialize(buffer, FH*) - Finds a file handle with the corresponding
 *		on-wire data in the storage and creates a new FH.
 *
 * FH Memory management.
 * ---------------------
 *
 * Since FHs are opaque to the callers, they are contructed with malloc() calls.
 * However, it is not so efficient when a caller has its own File Handle
 * structure which agregates CORTXFS FH. To prevent multiple allocations of the
 * same entity, FH provides methods for placement initialization in pre-allocated
 * buffers.
 * Methods:
 *	- create(args.., FH**) - Allocates memory and constructs a new FH.
 *	- create_inplace(args.., buffer) - Constructs FH in a pre-allocated
 *		memory region.
 *	- destroy(FH*) - Destroys internal data and deallocates memory.
 *	- destroy_inplace(FH*) - Destroys internal data.
 *	- inplace(buffer) - Macro to convert a uint8_t* to FH*.
 *
 * Note: Inplace memory management is safe with enabled pointer aliasing
 * optimizations as long as the API does not allow callers to use the same
 * buffer in more than one argument:
 * @{code}
 *	struct foo {
 *		int bar;
 *		int baz;
 *	};
 *	char buffer[64];
 *	#define FOO(_buf) ((struct foo*) _buf)
 *
 *	// Bad:
 *	#define FOO_BAR(_buf) &((struct foo*) _buf)->bar
 *	void fun1(struct foo *foo, int *bar) {
 *		*bar = 20;
 *		foo->bar = 10;
 *		printf("%d, *bar); // Prints 20 instead of 10
 *	}
 *	fun1(FOO(buffer), FOO_BAR(buffer));
 *
 *	// Better:
 *	struct foo *foo = FOO(buffer);
 *	fun1(foo, foo->bar); // Compiler can deduce bar's origin.
 *
 *	// Ideal:
 *	// Prevent the possiblity of aliasing
 *	void fun1(struct foo *foo);
 * @{endcode}
 *
 * Inplace memorty menagement is not implemented yet and will a part of
 * futher optimizations when CORTXFS FH will be fully integrated in CORTXFS
 * namespace code.
 *
 *
 * FH Compatibility layer.
 * -----------------------
 *
 * Migration to the new CORTXFS FH API requires a lot of changes in CORTXFS and
 * KVSFS. In order to keep backward compatibility during migration,
 * CORTXFS FH provides a set of function to use together new and the old APIs.
 * Those places are marked as "TODO:EOS-3288".

/* Notes for reviewers (it will be turned into doxygen comments later) :

 * 1. There is no need for fs_ctx anymore because each FH has a pointer
 * to the file system where the FH is located. It is required because
 * the on-wire FH handle has to be unique across the filesystems.
 * The Object:Filystem pair of FIDs is unique enough and can be easily
 * reconstructed without any additiona information and even might be used
 * outside of EFS.
 *
 * 2. cortxfs_ino_t arguments are replaced by cortxfs_fh_t. Because of that,
 * the callers should ensure to destroy the handles.
 *
 * 3. The example of CORTXFS API described below allocates new file handles in
 * heap. Later we can change that to use in-place allocated structures to
 * avoid extra malloc/free calls.
